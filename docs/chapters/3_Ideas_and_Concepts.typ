= Ideas and Concepts <sec:ideas_and_concepts>


// This is about the question of how you want to achieve the formulated goals of the work. For example, you record initial, rough ideas, sketchy approaches to solutions. 
// If there are several ways, approaches to achieve this goal, explain here why you are taking a particular path. Example for a software project: Initial thoughts on a 
// rough system architecture. Is a microservice architecture appropriate, for example? What alternatives are there, where are the problem areas? The implementation, the assessment 
// of feasibility and the detailed description of the implemented architecture are then part of the realization.\
// Differentiation from chapter 5:
// - If a key project objective is to create a security concept, a communication concept, a specialist IT concept or another specialist concept for your customers, for example, then the development of these (specialist) concepts is described under 'Realization' (after all, they are the actual core of your work). 
// - If, for example, a key objective of the work is to evaluate a suitable software architecture, then the corresponding descriptions belong in Chapter 5.
