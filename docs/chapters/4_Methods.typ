// This section is used to describe and justify which process model was chosen for this project. The approaches here describe how the goals for this project will be achieved.


// == Literature research <sub:literature_research>

// In order to gather the essential knowledge about encoders themselves, but also about the structure of Metasploit modules, the first step is a literature research.
// A literature research is a systematic search for scientific texts @balzertBook.  It forms the basis for the first part of this paper. The literature research 
// is used to determine the current state of research. It is also used to gather information for the proof of concept. 
// A systematic literature search using the terms 'ARM encoder' and 'AArch64 assembly' on Google Scholar is performed for this paper. Initially, a limited number of
// articles that address the key questions of the paper will be selected. Additional and more detailed literature on the topic was taken from the references and citations
// of the literature selected in the first search.\
// This way the vast majority of necessary information for the development can be gathered from different trusted sources.


// == Product <sub:product>

// The deliverable for this project is a shellcode encoder for AArch64 shellcodes as a valid Metasploit Framework (MSF) module. With the acquired knowledge from the 
// literature research, a working encoder for the chosen platform will be developed. \
// To ensure the robustness of the encoder, it will be tested with different, existing payloads from the MSF.
